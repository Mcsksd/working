Luminiferous aether theory disapproval
Question 1)
The luminiferous aether theory was formulated with the concept of light bearing. It was established as a medium through which light is propagated. In the explanation of the theory, light that is wave-based had the potential to be propagated in empty space although it was not consistent from time to time. All the theoretical concepts for waves of light were provided but the presumption of luminiferous aether’s spatial plenum was more than the spatial vacuum.  Fig 1.1
Through history, this theory created a lot of debate because an existence of infinite or invisible material for physical objects was required. This attracted disapproval by a number of theories (Ranzan et al, 2018). 
Question 2)
Although the anti-acceptors of this theory do not deny that it exists, there are a number of insufficiencies that drag it behind. The absence of aether drift in the theory attracted opposing opinions like the Maxwell’s electromagnetism and the dynamics of Newton. It was argued that the theory was comprised of difficulties and the manner of illustration of light was insufficient. It was invariant in comparison to the aforementioned works. 
Figure 2.1
The luminiferous aether theory failed and was considered incomplete because it was not compatible with the aether wind expectations. Contrary to the opinions of the theory, there is a seasonal variation of the earth’s velocity that moves it from the fringe of 0.4 to a higher level (Vary et al, 2016). Although the little variation of errors may appear zero, the theory is insufficient in its compatibility and illustrations. 
Question 3)
The new model – Michelson/Morley experiment
The presence of this theory was purely meant to challenge the existence of aether. The assumption of this experiment is that light waves carriers came through the medium of permeating space. The challenge was issued through an experiment performed in 1887 by Edward Morley and Albert Michelson in Cleveland, Ohio. Through the experiment, the perpendicular direct were compared to the speeds of light. 
As opposed to the luminiferous aether theory that was stationary, this experiment went ahead to evaluate matter’s relative motion in regard to the aether wind. When the evaluations were done, they turned negative and Albert and Edward conclude that there was no relationship between the direction of movement and the speed of light as it was suggested by the luminiferous aether theory. The earlier observation of aether wind for light speed and right angels was also found to be unsatisfactory. Their argument was considered to be proof enough that the luminiferous aether theory was not satisfactory and it was disapproved. 
Question 4)
Explanations of the model
In regard to the issues outlined above, there are explanations made by the model in a detailed manner;
They believed aether is a substance that fills the vacuum space of the earth. 
It was stipulated the earth moves in very high speed close to 100000km/h in a consistent way. 
They argued that light travels through aether spaces and the speeds are different at different times. The relative movement of the object through space is responsible in determining the speed with which the object will move.  Fig 4.1
They did the experiment to establish whether or not the aether theory exists and used the interferometer device to make conclusions. Through the observations, they outlined that aether is all around and the purpose for it is to fill the space of the earth. 
According to their theory, the existence and properties of any substance can be referred to as aether. They argued that water could not move alone and that it needs means and mediums to have transit. The sound waves were given an equal observation and that their movement was very essential. Edward and Albert went ahead to disapprove the fact that speed could move in right angels as earlier stipulated by the luminiferous aether theory (Fedi et al, 2019). 
Question 5
Predictions of model confirmation
There were different predictions of the above model that can be confirmed. The procedural experiment was able to shed the required light on a couple of concepts in the world of physics. After carrying out the procedure, it was ascertained that there was no difference direction of the earth in relation to speed of light and the same speed in relation to earth’s motion in right angels. Fig 5.1
Later in the years, Albert Einstein, a renowned world physics guru performed an experiment that challenged the luminiferous aether theory. He proved through his experiment that the theory was nil and that it did not carry as much weight because it was insufficient. The Albert and Edward experiment (new model) had earlier argued in just the same as Albert Einstein. This came in full support of their experiment and considering the immeasurable influence of Albert Einstein in the world of physics, the luminiferous aether theory was disapproved. 
The predictions they came up with after the experiment include;
Detecting the aether wind
The nature of light
What aether wind is all about
The nature of light
Whether or not light is a wave and
The wave-like nature of sound. 
Question 6)
Elaborations and applications of the model
Since the approval of the aforementioned model, the experiment has been able to inspire a lot of activities in the world of physics. Through it, the special theory of relativity was developed and established. The concept of gravitational waves in relation direction was brought to existence through the help of the model (Croca et al, 2019). 
The technique of optical interferetory has been greatly improved and the knowledge in it has been used to evaluate a number of detailed information concerning light. Many successful experiments have been launched in the course of history to serve a better course. It has led to increased and advanced technological advancements in the world of physics.
